| Feature | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| Tracing | Capture LLM calls, agent actions, and tool usage via OpenTelemetry-compatible SDK. Intelligently surfaces the traces that matter — noise filtered, signal prioritized. |
| Agentic Debugging | AI that sees all your traces, connects to a sandbox with your production source code, identifies the exact failing line, and correlates the failure with your GitHub commits, PRs, and issues. BYOK support for any model provider. |

## Why TraceRoot?

- **Traces alone don't scale.**

  As AI agent systems grow more complex, manually sifting through every trace is unsustainable. TraceRoot selectively screens your traces — filtering noise and surfacing only the ones that actually need attention, so you spend time fixing problems, not hunting for them.

- **Debugging AI agent systems is painful.**

  Root-causing failures across agent hallucinations, tool call instabilities, and version changes is hard. TraceRoot's AI connects to a sandbox running your production source code, identifies the exact failing line, and cross-references your GitHub history — commits, PRs, open issues and creates PR to fix it.

- **Fully open source, no vendor lock-in.**

  Both the observability platform and the AI debugging layer are open source. BYOK support for any model provider — OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, xAI, DeepSeek, OpenRouter, Kimi, GLM and more.

## Getting Started

### TraceRoot Cloud

The fastest way to get started. Ample storages and LLM tokens for testing, no credit card needed. Sign up [here](https://app.traceroot.ai)!

### Self-Hosting

- Developer mode: Run TraceRoot locally to contribute.

  ```bash
  # Get a copy of the latest repo
  git clone https://github.com/traceroot-ai/traceroot.git
  cd traceroot

  # Hosted the infras in docker and app itself locally
  make dev
  ```
  For more details, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

- Local docker mode: Run TraceRoot locally to test.

  ```bash
  # Get a copy of the latest repo
  git clone https://github.com/traceroot-ai/traceroot.git
  cd traceroot

  # Hosted everything in docker
  make prod
  ```

- [Terraform (AWS)](./deploy/): Run TraceRoot on k8s with Helm and Terraform. This is for production hosting. Still in experimental stage.

## SDK

| Language | Repository |
| -------- | ---------- |
| Python | [traceroot-py](https://github.com/traceroot-ai/traceroot-py) |
| TypeScript / Node.js | [`frontend/packages/sdk-node`](./frontend/packages/sdk-node) |

## Python SDK Quickstart

```bash
pip install traceroot openai
```

```bash
# Add these in the `.env` file in root directory
TRACEROOT_API_KEY="tr-0f29d..."
TRACEROOT_HOST_URL="https://app.traceroot.ai"  # cloud (default)
```

```python
import traceroot
from traceroot import Integration, observe
from openai import OpenAI

traceroot.initialize(integrations=[Integration.OPENAI])
client = OpenAI()

@observe(name="my_agent", type="agent")
def my_agent(query: str) -> str:
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": query}],
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content

if __name__ == "__main__":
    my_agent("What's the weather in SF?")
```
